# Coding Style Guides & Best Practices

Writing readable code is an art and following style guides is one way of ensuring our code is always clean, readable and consistent. Language specific style guides exist but general coding standards apply to all programming languages. These are not to be blindly followed; strive to understand these and ask when in doubt.

## General
-   Don't duplicate the functionality of a built-in library (Note that this is not the case if the task at hand is purely algorithmic).
-   Don't swallow exceptions or "fail silently".
-   Don't write code that guesses at future functionality.
-   Exceptions should be exceptional.
